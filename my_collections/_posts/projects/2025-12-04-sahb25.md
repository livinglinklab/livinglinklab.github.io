## Introduction

The Fall 2025 iteration of Smart and Healthy Buildings culminates in eight
student groups researching what the future of smart and healthy buildings should
look like. The projects improve how we analyze data from buildings, show us
how we can integrate AI better into future building-focused systems, and
help resolve real-world problems with maintaining our buildings.

### Spatial Energy Visualization and Nighttime Anomaly Detection for the University of Virginia's Living Link Lab

In order to precisely characterize building power usage, sensors sample data multiple
times per minute; however, this results in large, complex datasets that make
meaningful insights hard to extract. An interactive, color-coded map of power usage
provides an intuitive summary of how power usage varies both room by room and
through time. This maintains data integrity while increasing usability. Data was first
analyzed using Python, and then exported to Power BI to create visualizations that can
be easily accessed. A room occupant can then use this output to see how their power
usage compares to that of their neighbors or if a device has been left on overnight. It
can be utilized by a building manager to find potential locations of energy latency,
allowing them to make relevant adjustments, reducing power usage and costs.

### AI Generated Building Summary: From Sensor Data to Daily Report

**Authors**: Samriddhi Kumar, Jack Hauger, Kushan Dixit, Evin St Clair, Benjamin Oppong

<img src="/img/sahb-25f/SaHB-Report.png" style="float:right;width:400px;">
Our project develops an AI‑powered Smart Building Intelligence System that
automatically processes real sensor data streams—such as temperature, CO₂, VOCs,
occupancy, and environmental metrics—to generate daily operational summaries for
facility managers. The system ingests raw building data, computes performance features,
detects potential anomalies, and uses a large language model to produce clear, actionable
reports. This enables faster decision‑making, enhances occupant comfort and safety, and
modernizes building management workflows through automated intelligence.



### Creating a Visual Interface to Display Indoor Conditions

**Authors**: Kayla Sprincis, Logan Brock, Xiling Meng, Danielle Sydow

<img src="/img/sahb-25f/SaHB-Group4_Image.png" style="float:right;width:200px;">
Modern building sensors can provide valuable information regarding occupants’ health, comfort, and
safety. However, the scale and complexity of collected time-series data often make the data's real-world
implications inaccessible to non-technical users. This paper presents a visual interface designed to
translate real-time sensor measurements for six key building metrics – temperature, carbon dioxide,
volatile organic compounds, humidity, noise, and illumination – into a digitally displayed, intuitive
color-coded diagram. The system combines simple time-series analytics with a large language model
(LLM), which interprets sensor readings, trends, and predefined health-related thresholds to select
representative hexadecimal colors. A Streamlit web application displays the model's outputs in a dynamic
packed bubble chart, which adapts to emphasize the most critical metric levels at any given time. Tests for
consistency demonstrate that the LLM’s color assignments remain stable for identical metric inputs and
vary appropriately across distinct environmental conditions. The resulting interface streamlines
interpretation of indoor conditions, rendering building data more accessible to technical and non-technical
audiences alike. This work showcases the capacity of AI-assisted visualization to generalize IoT data,
while highlighting future opportunities to improve accessibility, interpretability, and reliability through
user studies and refined prompt engineering.
