## Introduction

The Fall 2025 iteration of Smart and Healthy Buildings culminates in eight
student groups researching what the future of smart and healthy buildings should
look like. The projects improve how we analyze data from buildings, show us
how we can integrate AI better into future building-focused systems, and
help resolve real-world problems with maintaining our buildings.

## Time and Location

- **Date**: Friday, December 12, 2025
- **Time**: 2:00PM - 5:00PM
- **Location**: Rice 340
